"""Check every hadith shown on the screen against the Sunni collections -> hadith/report.json.

Run by hand (python3 .github/tools/verify_hadith.py) where the texts are reachable. Each hadith in
assets/shared/hadith.json is searched (letters only, harakat and punctuation ignored) in the Arabic text of
the six books from github.com/fawazahmed0/hadith-api, and every book and hadith number it appears in is
recorded. A hadith found in none of them must not be shown.

For the four Sunan the scholars' grades of each narration (Al-Albani and others, as the API's English editions
carry them, matched by hadith number) are read too; a narration graded weak is not picked when another holds the
words, and the grades are kept in the report.

For each found hadith the full narration is kept too, exactly as the book has it (chain of narrators and all):
one whose isnad is at most ISNAD_MAX_WORDS words (a very long chain is not picked when a shorter one exists), in
the first book in the order below that has one, then the shortest (in al-Tirmidhi, one he grades صحيح or حسن
first), so the screen can show the whole hadith, not an excerpt.
